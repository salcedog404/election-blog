<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Up until this week, we have looked at more “predictable” factors that go into predicting election outcomes. For my 2022 model, I’ve explored incorporating everything from <a href="https://salcedog404.github.io/election-blog/post/2022-09-16-blog-post-2/">economic variables</a> and <a href="https://salcedog404.github.io/election-blog/post/2022-09-26-blog-post-3-polling/">polling</a> to <a href="https://salcedog404.github.io/election-blog/post/2022-09-30-blog-post-4-incumbency-and-expert-predictions/">expert predictions</a> and <a href="https://salcedog404.github.io/election-blog/post/2022-10-10-blog-post-5-the-air-war/">ad spending</a>.</p>
<p>What about “shocks?” As we learned, shocks can be a major, nationwide phenomenon, such as the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision, or shocks can be more local and candidate-specific, like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion.html">story</a> that broke about Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker paying for a girlfriend’s abortion despite his pro-life stance. Regardless, shocks are these often unexpected events that are seen as being capable of “shaking up the race.”</p>
<p>The degree to which these “shocks” influence the outcome of the election likely varies by the type of shock and - in my view - the timing of the shock. As we discussed before, Dobbs is a good example of a major political shock, as the national political environment shifted towards the Democrats significantly for several months. Had the midterms been held in August, I believe Democrats would have been in the strongest possible position since they would still be riding the wave of momentum from the decision early in the summer, but because of the timing of the election, enough time has passed that the impact of Dobbs has begun to slowly decrease. Still, Democrats are probably in a better position heading into election day thanks to Dobbs than they normally would be for a midterm where they are the party in power (where losing seats in both chambers is all but expected).</p>
<p>One example of timing that actually may have made a significant difference was back in the 2016 election, when former FBI director James Comey reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails about a week before the election. Clinton’s poll numbers were strong throughout October, and it had seemed like the election would be hers to lose, but reopening the investigation just a week before the election tightened the race last minute, potentially contributing to Donald Trump’s shocking upset on election night.</p>

<h1>Updated 2022 Model</h1>
<p>Shockingly (pun intended), even though this week was about shocks, this blog post will serve more as a major update to my 2022 model than a post about shocks themselves. Although shocks like Dobbs are certainly significant, I ultimately decided that for my final model I would leave out shocks entirely due to their unpredictable nature.</p>
<p>In addition, after continuing to play around with district-level forecasting, I also decided to return to forecasting on the national level, as I feel more confident in my ability to build a stronger national model in preparation for my final prediction, which will come out on November 7. In addition to national vote share, I will also now forecast national House seat share to paint a more complete picture of my election prediction. Finally, as I have been doing in the last few posts, I will continue to make predictions for CA-27, the district that I have been following.</p>
