<p><em>This blog is part of a series for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> taught by Professor <a href="http://ryandenos.com/">Ryan D. Enos</a></em>.</p>
<p>Welcome to the very first post in my election blog series! My name is Giovanni Salcedo, and I am a senior studying Government on the Data Science track. For my first post, I aim to provide some background on how midterms usually look like for the party in power, which should help provide context for my predictions for the 2022 midterms. In particular, <strong>how do <em>Democrats</em> fare in midterm elections when they are the incumbent party?</strong> To address this question, I will analyze the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, during President Barack Obamaâ€™s two terms in office.</p>
